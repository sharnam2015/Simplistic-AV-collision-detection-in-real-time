# Simplsitic-AV-collision-detection-in-real-time
//Done for ME235, Design of Microprocessor Based Systems Course Project at Berkeley
I built a simple collision detection simulation for my design of microprocessor systems course 

I used the PSoC 5 MCU, along with LabVIEW, C and location to detect collisions in real time and stop the cars.
A 2 car simulation is done in this project. When the distance between the 2 cars becomes lower than a limit a collision is detected and the cars are stopped.
